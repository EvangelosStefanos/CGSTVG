# Context-Guided Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding
ðŸ”® Welcome to the official code repository for [**Context-Guided Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01578). We're excited to share our work with you, please bear with us as we prepare code. Stay tuned for the reveal!

## Framework

**Figure:** Overview of our method, which consists of a multimodal encoder for feature extraction and a context-guided decoder by cascading
a set of decoding stages for grounding. In each decoding stage, instance context is mined to guide query learning for better localization. More details can be seen in the [**paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01578).
